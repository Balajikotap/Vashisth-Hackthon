    weather App , wikipideia search engine and  QR Generator

DESCRIPTION 

Weather App:
    In This Application we used the  fronted End HTML for structure , CSS for styling the our application and JAVA Script for the functionality
    if the user will enter the city name it will give the temperature , humidity and wind speed of the current scenario. the functionality of the JS is by taking     the user entered city name and it will send the request to server through the API keys, we used the JS promise and fetch methods and get methods to sending the 
   request to servers
    and JSON methods. The response of the server will give the information data we converted into the array and objects through the indies values we accesed and     
     displayed to the user

     Further  development of our Application is to added suggestions to make user better understand by collecting of the previous history of the data

     EXAMPLE

     Rahul Rana was one person who entered the city name Madurai so he got the respective data by collecting of the previous data we may give suggestion if the   
     temperature was cloudy we can give suggestions like Better to carry the Umberlla, Raincoat
